# Using Object.assign

## Learning Goals

- Identify `Object.assign`
- Non-destructively assign new data with `Object.assign()`
- Explain Performance Gains from non-Destructive Updates

## Introduction

In JavaScript, we have access to a global `Object` that comes with several
helpful methods ready for us to use. One of these methods is `Object.assign()`,
which allows us to combine properties from multiple `Object`s into a single
`Object`. In this lesson, we're going to see how to use `Object.assign` to do
just that.

## Identify `Object.assign()`

The first argument passed to `Object.assign()` is the first `Object` into which
all of the properties are merged. Every additional argument is an `Object` whose
properties we want to merge into the first `Object`:

```js
Object.assign(firstObject, secondObject, thirdObject, ...);
```

The return value of `Object.assign()` is the first `Object` after all of the
additional `Object`s' properties have been merged in:

```js
Object.assign({ eggs: 3 }, { flour: '1 cup' });
// => { eggs: 3, flour: "1 cup" }

Object.assign({ eggs: 3 }, { chocolateChips: '1 cup', flour: '2 cups' }, { flour: '1/2 cup' });
// { eggs: 3, chocolateChips: "1 cup", flour: "1/2 cup" }
```

Let's look at the `flour` property in the above example. **If multiple
`Object`s have a property with the same key, the last key to be defined wins
out**. Essentially, the last call to `Object.assign()` in the above snippet is
wrapping all of the following assignments into a single line of code:

```js
const recipe = { eggs: 3 };

recipe.chocolateChips = '1 cup';

recipe.flour = '2 cups';

recipe.flour = '1/2 cup';
```

## Non-Destructively Assign New Data with `Object.assign()`

A common pattern for `Object.assign()` is to provide an empty `Object` as the
first argument. That way we're providing an entirely new `Object` instead of
modifying or overwriting the properties of an existing `Object`.

```js
function nondestructivelyUpdateObject(obj, key, value) {
  return Object.assign({}, obj, { [key]: value });
}

const recipe = { eggs: 3 };

const newRecipe = nondestructivelyUpdateObject(recipe, 'chocolate', '1 cup');
// => { eggs: 3, chocolate: "1 cup" }

newRecipe;
// => { eggs: 3, chocolate: "1 cup" }

recipe;
// => { eggs: 3 }
```

In other languages (like Ruby), this behavior is called "merging." You take
a original base `Object` (maybe with some typical "standard" attribute / value
pairs already set), and then you "merge" in additional Object(s).

It's important that we merge everything into a new, empty `Object`. Otherwise,
we would be modifying the original `Object`. In your browser's console, test
what happens if the body of the above function were `return Object.assign(obj, {
[key]: value });`.

Uh-oh! Back to being destructive! Fortunately, we can avoid that by following
the example above.

## Explain Performance Gains from non-Destructive Updates

Doing non-destructive updates (i.e. "creating new things and merging on top")
is a really important pattern. It turns out that, in many places, non-destructive
updates are _more performant_. The main reason on this is when you add something
to an existing `Object`, the computer has to make sure that the `Object` has
enough room to add what you're saying to add. If it doesn't, the computer needs
to do cleanup work, find some more space, copy the old thing over, add the new,
thing, and then resume work, etc. That "accounting" process is actually quite
slow.

`Object.assign`, however, avoids all that and says: "Hey, I created a thing that
looks like this, give me space for it." This is faster.

_Advanced: For Your Information_

Furthermore, in the cloud-based world of programming we're moving more and more
to, we can't be sure that two computers will share the same memory. They
might be servers separated by centimeters or kilometers. When a design like this
is used, we'll need to be sure to make sure the functions have "all they need"
to run a function call _independently_ i.e. they have their own copy of the data
they need and aren't sharing memory with other machines.

We won't encounter these concerns in this module; however, cloud-based languages
like Google's Go require us to think in this different paradigm to achieve
massive scale. So, file it away for later!

## Conclusion

Depending on how you need to use it, `Object.assign` can be useful in both
destructive and non-destructive ways. Play around with it in your console. What
happens when you use different data types while combining objects? The results
might surprise you!
